# Infinite Evolution

The goal of the game will be to detonate an anti-matter bomb, which wipes the server and starts the game over again.
A few things persist

* [ ] Collectibles are dropped in the location that the character is in, the chance to capture them then moves to that location for the next round
* [ ] Everyone is sent back to the Prehistoric age, but you keep your character count (this is why it's expensive to gain an extra character)
* [ ] You keep a portion of your stats depending on the items you own and your evolution at the time of the detonation.
